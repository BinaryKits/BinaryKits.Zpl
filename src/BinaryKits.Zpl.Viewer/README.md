# Open Tasks

- Barcodes scaling
- Calculate label size by the drawn elements
- Optimize font drawing for different font names
- Optimize GraphicBox drawing special border (^XA^FO50,50^GB100,100,120,B,1^FS^XZ)
- Add more elements (^GE Graphic Ellipse, ^GS Graphic Symbol, ...)
- NetBarcode not support Interleaved2of5

# Example code

```
IPrinterStorage printerStorage = new PrinterStorage();
var drawer = new ZplElementDrawer(printerStorage);

var analyzer = new ZplAnalyzer(printerStorage);
var analyzeInfo = analyzer.Analyze(request.ZplData);

foreach (var labelInfo in analyzeInfo.LabelInfos)
{
	var imageData = drawer.Draw(labelInfo.ZplElements);
	//imageData is bytes of png image
}
```

# Adding Barcode support
Also applies to other "drawables", like shapes and graphics.

## Common barcodes still missing support
### 1D
- [ ] Code 93: Supported by Xzing.net
- [ ] MSI: Supported by Xzing.net
- [ ] Codabar/NW7: Supported by Xzing.net
- [ ] Databar/RSS-14: Not supported by Xzing.net
- [ ] [Code 11](https://web.archive.org/web/20070202060711/http://www.barcodeisland.com/code11.phtml): Not supported by Xzing.net, simple to implement

### 2D
- [ ] Maxicode: Not supported by Xzing.net, required for UPS labels
- [ ] Aztec: Supported by Xzing.net
- [ ] Micro pdf417: Not supported by Xzing.net
	- ascii data only
	- appears to be a subset of pdf417
- [ ] Micro QrCode: Not supported by Xzing.net
	- appears to be a subset of QrCode
- [ ] Composite: Not supported by Xzing.net, simple to implement

## Examples

- [Datamatrix Barcode](https://github.com/BinaryKits/BinaryKits.Zpl/commit/f79d01512eee7e3d16246e932877ca6d4aa4e306)
- [PDF417 Barcode](https://github.com/BinaryKits/BinaryKits.Zpl/pull/190/files)

## Steps
Generally, looking at files in the directory for each step should give you a clue on how to implement a file.

### 1: Create the abstract element
This is a class used to represent the barcode with all it's settings, mostly to be used for zpl generation.
We are currently in the middle of a (stalled) refactor which leads to some amount of code duplication.
A class should be created in these `<project>/<directory>`:
- `BinaryKits.Zpl.Label/Elements/`
- `BinaryKits.Zpl.Protocol/Commands/`

For 2d barcodes, implement `ZplPositionedElementBase` and `IFormatElement`, for 1d barcodes, subclass `ZplBarcode`

### 2: Create a model in `BinaryKits.Zpl.Viewer/Models/`
This one is only used for the viewer project and should contain mostly the same properties as the class created in the previous step.

### 3: Create the command analyzer in `BinaryKits.Zpl.Viewer/CommandAnalyzers/`
This is where you write the code for parsing zpl to the Model/Element.

- Subclass from `ZplCommandAnalyzerBase`
- Use `this.SplitCommand` get all the zpl arguments
- Remember to check that the length of args array is long enough before trying to parse at an index
- Remember to set the defaults each parameter before parsing
	- There are parameters stored in the virtual printer such as `^BY`
	- Otherwise use the defaults as described in the zpl programming manual
- Because there is always data to encode, set the next field data encountered by the virtual printer to return the content to the model

### 4: Add an entry to `BinaryKits.Zpl.Viewer/CommandAnalyzers/FieldDataZplCommandAnalyzer.cs`
This is to make sure that we grab the `text`, the model from the previous step it into a new instance of the abstract element.

Find the massive `if` chain following `if (this.VirtualPrinter.NextElementFieldData != null)` and add an entry for your mode.

Architecturally, this type of hard binding is probably not good. We should probably fix this.

### 5: Add an entry to `BinaryKits.Zpl.Viewer/ZPLAnalyzer.cs`
Find the List `elementAnalyzers` and instantiate your analyzer there.

### 6: Create a drawer in `BinaryKits.Zpl.Viewer/ElementDrawers`
- Subclass `BarcodeDrawerBase`
- Implement `CanDraw` by checking against the abstract element in step 1.
- Implement `Draw`. Working from the end:
	- The end goal is to write some pixels (a skia bitmap) to the base canvas with `this.DrawBarcode`
	- Those pixels will be obtained by converting an abstract barcode drawing to a png `SKBitmap`
	- The abstract drawing will be generated by calling an external library with the correct parameters obtained from the abstract element
		- Zxing.net uses hints to pass in extra parameters
	- Some adaptative helper functions may needed to convert between the library types and skia bitmaps or binarykit.zpl models
	- `BarcodeDrawerBase` may have some helper functions needed

### 7: Add an entry to `BinaryKits.Zpl.Viewer/ZPLElementDrawer.cs`
Find the array `this._elementDrawers` and instantiate your drawer there.

### 8: Create a test in to `BinaryKits.Zpl.Viewer.UnitTest/DrawerTest.cs`
- todo: load data from BinaryKits.Zpl.Viewer.UnitTest/Data/zpl like in the webapi project
- Use the `DefaultPrint` function when possible, you can pass dimensions, density and drawer options
- todo: an empty custom file `BinaryKits.Zpl.Viewer.UnitTest/Data/zpl/custom.zpl2` is not under vcs to enable quick testing
